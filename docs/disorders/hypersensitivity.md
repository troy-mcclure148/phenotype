# **Hypersensitivity**

*This comprehensive review explores the concept of neurodiversity, with a focus on Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS) and its relationship to various biopsychosocial factors, including personality traits, mental health conditions, stress reactivity, and occupational gender differences. The review synthesizes information from diverse sources to provide a holistic understanding of these interconnected topics and identifies areas for further research.*

## **Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS)**
### **Characteristics and Implications**
#### **Definition and Prevalence**
- **20-35%** highly sensitive, **41-47%** moderately sensitive, **20-35%** low sensitivity ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128182512000035))

#### **Evolutionary Significance**
- Neutral trait evolved in **20%** of the population as a survival advantage in some situations ([source](https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage))

#### **Cognitive and Behavioral Characteristics**
- *Deeper processing, awareness of subtleties, easily overstimulated* ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100650))
- *Greater activation in brain areas for high-order visual processing and attention to detail* ([source](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2010-04-sensitive-people-brains-differently.html))

#### **Advantages and Challenges**
- *Advantages in certain situations, but risk for overstimulation and stress* ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763418306250?via%3Dihub))
