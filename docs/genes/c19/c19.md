# Chromosome 19

Chromosome 19 contains several genes of interest in the context of the RCCX theory, including [GSD](gsd.md), [GST](gst.md), and [NOTCH](notch.md). GSD, or glycogen storage disease, is a group of inherited disorders characterized by impaired glycogen metabolism. GST, or glutathione S-transferase, is a family of enzymes involved in detoxification and antioxidant defense. NOTCH genes encode transmembrane proteins that play crucial roles in cell signaling and development. Variations in these genes may interact with RCCX-related factors to influence disease susceptibility and progression.
