# **Chromosome 14**

Chromosome 14 harbors two genes relevant to the **RCCX theory**: [**SERPIN-A1**](serpin-a1.md) and [**SERPIN-B2**](serpin-b2.md).

- **SERPIN-A1**, as mentioned earlier, encodes *alpha-1-antitrypsin*.
- **SERPIN-B2** encodes *plasminogen activator inhibitor-2*, another member of the serine protease inhibitor family.

Both genes play important roles in regulating **inflammation**, **tissue remodeling**, and **cell survival**. Variations in these genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of RCCX-related disorders through their effects on **protease activity** and **inflammatory processes**.
