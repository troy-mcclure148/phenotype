# SERPINA1 (Serpin Family A Member 1)

## Introduction
SERPINA1, also known as Serpin Family A Member 1, is a protein-coding gene that belongs to the serpin superfamily. The SERPINA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), which is a type of serine protease inhibitor (serpin) [1]. AAT plays a crucial role in protecting tissues from damage caused by excessive proteolytic activity, particularly in the lungs.

## Gene Location and Function
The SERPINA1 gene is located on chromosome 14q32.13 [1]. It encodes alpha-1 antitrypsin, a glycoprotein that is primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream [2]. The primary function of AAT is to inhibit neutrophil elastase, a serine protease that breaks down elastin, a protein that provides elasticity to tissues such as the lungs [2].

In addition to inhibiting the excess of free elastase from neutrophils, pancreas, or bacteria, AAT neutralizes various other proteases, including [3]:
- Proteinase-3, myeloperoxidase, cathepsin G, and α-defensins from neutrophils
- Chymase and tryptase from mast cells
- Trypsin from pancreas
- Granzyme-B from T lymphocytes
- Circulating kallikreins 7 and 14
- Coagulation cascade serine proteinases plasmin, thrombin, urokinase, and factor Xa

AAT provides >90% of the antiproteinase activity in human serum, with the remaining 10% belonging to α-2 macroglobulin [3].

## Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (A1AD or AATD)
Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD or AATD), a genetic disorder that may result in lung disease or liver disease [1]. Onset of lung problems is typically between 20 and 50 years old and may result in shortness of breath, wheezing, or an increased risk of lung infections [1].

In a study by Duda et al. [4], dedifferentiated hepatoma cells were used to define pathways that determine liver identity. The rat Serpina1 gene was strongly repressed (55–90-fold) in each of the variant cell lines tested compared to the parental Fg14 cells, indicating the importance of SERPINA1 in maintaining liver function [4].

## Testing for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
The level of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the blood can be measured using an Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Blood Test [5]. This test is useful in diagnosing A1AD and monitoring the treatment of individuals with the disorder.

## Conclusion
SERPINA1 is a crucial gene that encodes alpha-1 antitrypsin, a serine protease inhibitor that plays a vital role in protecting tissues from damage caused by excessive proteolytic activity. Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene can lead to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disorder that may result in lung or liver disease. Understanding the function of SERPINA1 and its role in disease pathogenesis is essential for the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for individuals with A1AD and related conditions.
