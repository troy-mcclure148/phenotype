# The MHC Gamma Block and Chronic Disease Susceptibility

## Overview

The **MHC gamma block** is a genomic region located between the **HLA-B/C block** (the delta block) and the **HLA-DRB/DQB block** (the beta block) of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the short arm of chromosome 6 [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html). This region contains several genes that play crucial roles in **immune function**, **inflammation**, and **autoimmunity**, making it a potential contributor to various chronic diseases. While the RCCX module (consisting of RP1, C4, CYP21, and TNXB genes) within the gamma block has been extensively studied, other genes in this region also warrant attention for their potential roles in disease susceptibility.

## Genes in the MHC Gamma Block (Outside the RCCX Module)

- **SKIV2L** (OMIM 600478): SKIV2L encodes for the Ski2-like RNA helicase, which is a component of the SKI complex involved in RNA processing and turnover. Mutations in SKIV2L are associated with Trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES), a rare congenital disorder characterized by severe diarrhea and immune deficiency [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html). Additionally, SNPs in the SKIV2L gene have been associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) susceptibility [^13^](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/21/18/4138/588956).

- **DOM3Z** (OMIM 605996): DOM3Z, also known as FAM103A1, is a gene with less characterized functions. It is part of the Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) DOM3Z gene family, but its specific roles in humans are still being studied [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html).

- **STK19** (OMIM 604977): STK19 encodes for the protein Serine/Threonine Kinase 19, which is involved in various cellular processes including cell proliferation and differentiation. Its exact role in human physiology and disease is still being elucidated [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html).

- **CFB** (OMIM 138470): CFB encodes for complement factor B, which is a component of the complement system involved in immune responses. It plays a role in the alternative pathway of complement activation, contributing to the clearance of pathogens and immune complexes [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html). Polymorphisms in the CFB gene have been associated with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis [^9^](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21484033_Common_variable_immunodeficiency_is_associated_with_polymorphic_markers_in_the_human_major_histocompatibility_complex).

- **C2** (OMIM 613927): C2 encodes for complement component C2, which is also involved in the complement cascade. C2 is a critical component of both the classical and lectin pathways of complement activation, ultimately leading to the destruction of target cells or pathogens [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html). Polymorphisms in the C2 gene have been linked to autoimmune disorders like SLE and type 1 diabetes [^9^](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21484033_Common_variable_immunodeficiency_is_associated_with_polymorphic_markers_in_the_human_major_histocompatibility_complex).

- **EHMT2** (OMIM 604599): EHMT2, also known as G9a-like protein, encodes for a histone methyltransferase that mediates methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9). It plays a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, chromatin organization, and various cellular processes such as development and differentiation [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html).

## Associations with Chronic Diseases

Several studies have linked the genes in the MHC gamma block (outside the RCCX module) to various chronic diseases:

- **Autoimmune disorders**: Polymorphisms in C2 and CFB genes have been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes [^9^](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21484033_Common_variable_immunodeficiency_is_associated_with_polymorphic_markers_in_the_human_major_histocompatibility_complex).

- **Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)**: SNPs in the SKIV2L gene have been associated with AMD susceptibility [^13^](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/21/18/4138/588956).

- **Trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES)**: Mutations in the SKIV2L gene can cause THES, a rare congenital disorder characterized by severe diarrhea and immune deficiency [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html).

## Mechanisms of Disease Susceptibility

The genes in the MHC gamma block (outside the RCCX module) may contribute to chronic disease susceptibility through various mechanisms:

- **Complement system dysfunction**: Variations in C2 and CFB genes can lead to impaired complement activation and immune clearance, promoting inflammation and autoimmunity [^9^](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21484033_Common_variable_immunodeficiency_is_associated_with_polymorphic_markers_in_the_human_major_histocompatibility_complex).

- **RNA processing and turnover**: Mutations in the SKIV2L gene, which is involved in RNA processing and turnover, can cause immune deficiency and other symptoms associated with THES [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html).

- **Epigenetic regulation**: The EHMT2 gene, which encodes for a histone methyltransferase, plays a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and various cellular processes. Alterations in its function may influence disease susceptibility [^1^](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2019/0264282.html).

## Conclusion

While the RCCX module within the MHC gamma block has been extensively studied, other genes in this region, such as SKIV2L, DOM3Z, STK19, CFB, C2, and EHMT2, also warrant attention for their potential roles in disease susceptibility. These genes have been linked to various chronic diseases, including autoimmune disorders, age-related macular degeneration, and rare congenital disorders like THES. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which variations in these genes contribute to disease risk and to develop targeted interventions for individuals with high-risk genotypes.
