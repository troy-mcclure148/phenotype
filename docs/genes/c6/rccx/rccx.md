# **The RCCX Module: Genetic Complexity, Disease Associations, and Implications for the Stress-Diathesis Model**

## **Introduction**

The **RCCX module**, situated within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6, is a highly intricate genetic locus. It includes several essential genes: **complement component 4 (C4)**, **serine/threonine kinase (STK19)**, **cytochrome P450 21-hydroxylase (CYP21)**, and **tenascin-X (TNX)** [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5656502/)]. This gene cluster shows significant variability in gene copy numbers, structure, and allelic polymorphisms, playing a role in various autoimmune, endocrine, and neuropsychiatric disorders [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)]. This article delves into the complexities of the RCCX module, its genetic variations, and their implications for disease susceptibility and the stress-diathesis model.

## **Genetic Structure and Variability**

The RCCX module consists of four primary genes: **STK19**, **C4**, **CYP21**, and **TNX**. The presence of pseudogenes and variations in gene copy numbers adds to the complexity of this region [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)]. At least 15 variants of the RCCX modules have been identified, characterized by different combinations of long and short C4 genes [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477366/)]. These copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to the genetic diversity observed in the RCCX module [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477366/)].

The **C4 gene**, in particular, exhibits a complex pattern of variations in gene number, size, and nucleotide polymorphism [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)]. Duplication or deletion of a C4 gene always occurs as a discrete unit of the RCCX module, which contains one C4 gene, one CYP21 gene, one TNX gene, and one STK19 gene [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)]. The C4 gene can be either long (C4L) or short (C4S), with the long variant containing an endogenous retrovirus **HERV-K(C4)** integrated into the ninth intron [[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)]. The frequency of bimodular RCCX is 69%, while monomodular and trimodular RCCX structures account for 17.0% and 14.0%, respectively. Three-quarters of C4 genes harbor the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K(C4), and partial deficiencies of C4A and C4B, primarily due to gene deletions and homoexpression of C4A proteins, have a combined frequency of 31.6% [[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)].

## **Disease Associations**

### **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)**

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is often linked to variations in the **CYP21A2 gene** within the RCCX module. Mutations in CYP21A2 can cause a spectrum of CAH phenotypes, ranging from severe salt-wasting to simple virilizing forms [[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477366/)]. The genetic complexity of the RCCX module, including the presence of a highly homologous pseudogene (**CYP21A1P**), can lead to gene conversion events and deletions, contributing to the pathogenesis of CAH [[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477366/)]. A systematic assessment of the genetic and evolutionary variation of the RCCX module in CAH patients revealed a significant increase in the monomodular structure with a long C4 gene linked to the pseudogene CYP21A1P and bimodular structures with two CYP21A1P, likely generated by recombinations between heterozygous RCCX length variants [[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477366/)].

### **Complement System Disorders**

Variations in the **C4 gene**, including partial deficiencies and CNVs, are associated with various autoimmune diseases [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)]. The presence of endogenous retroviruses within the C4 gene can also affect its function and expression [[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)]. The complement system's involvement in gene-environment interactions underscores its role in autoimmune diseases like **systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)** and **rheumatoid arthritis (RA)** [[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5209734/)].

### **Neuropsychiatric Disorders**

Overactivity of the **C4 gene** within the RCCX module has been implicated in **schizophrenia**, likely due to its role in synaptic pruning during brain development [[7](https://www.labroots.com/trending/immunology/16637/overactive-immune-gene-cause-schizophrenia)]. The genetic variations in the RCCX module may contribute to the stress-diathesis model of schizophrenia, where genetic predisposition interacts with environmental factors to influence disease onset and progression [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5656502/)].

### **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)**

The **TNXB gene**, encoding tenascin-X, is crucial for collagen synthesis and deposition in the extracellular matrix. Deficiency in tenascin-X due to TNXB mutations leads to classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (clEDS), characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and chronic musculoskeletal pain [[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7148)]. Mutations in TNXB can cause classical-like EDS, with studies showing a higher prevalence of joint hypermobility in females with TNXB haploinsufficiency [[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7148)]. The TNXB gene partially overlaps with CYP21A2, and deletions affecting both genes can result in a contiguous gene syndrome combining CAH and EDS, highlighting the complex interplay within the RCCX module [[9](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/481911)].

### **STK19 and Its Implications**

**STK19**, a serine/threonine kinase gene within the RCCX module, has been identified as a critical player in **NRAS-driven melanoma** [[10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30712867/)]. A gain-of-function mutation (D89N) in STK19 enhances NRAS activity, promoting melanocyte transformation and melanoma progression [[10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30712867/)]. However, the role of STK19 in melanoma remains contested, with some studies questioning the mutation's impact on NRAS signaling [[11](https://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/9/4/OF8)]. Further research is needed to clarify the functional significance of STK19 variations in cancer and other diseases.

STK19 encodes a nuclear protein that can bind ATP at its kinase domain and phosphorylate certain proteins at Ser/Thr residues [[12](https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/8859.html)]. STK19 is a nuclear kinase involved in RNA binding during transcription and DNA repair, although its precise functional properties and disease associations are still being uncovered [[12](https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/8859.html)].

## **Genetic and Functional Insights**

The RCCX module's genetic structure includes endogenous retroviruses, particularly **HERV-K(C4)**, integrated within the C4 gene [[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)]. These retroviral elements may influence gene expression and immune responses, potentially offering protection against retroviral infections [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477366/)]. Additionally, certain RCCX haplotypes exhibit strong linkage disequilibrium with specific TNF alleles, indicating a co-inheritance pattern that could influence disease susceptibility [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193198/)].

The maintenance of the CYP21 enzyme function is critical and could lead to negative selection, whereas the presumed gene regulation altering steroid hormone levels via intron 2 might help fast adaptation, which broadly characterizes the genes of human CNVs responding to the environment [[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24312389)]. The **CYP21A2 gene** is one of the most diverse human genes, with significant variability observed in intron 2. This intronic diversity may contribute to fast adaptation in response to environmental changes, despite the need to maintain enzyme function through negative selection [[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24312389)].

**Vitamin D** has been shown to regulate CYP21A2 transcription, revealing a novel mechanism by which vitamin D can influence steroid hormone levels and potentially mitigate some effects of CYP21A2 mutations [[14](https://www.docdroid.net/AK3jVkW/vdr-cyp21a2.pdf)]. Systematic evaluations have identified common genetic variants of CYP21A2 that correlate with differences in circulating hormone levels, underscoring the gene's impact on endocrine function [[15](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265559244_Common_Genetic_Variants_of_the_Human_Steroid_21-Hydroxylase_Gene_CYP21A2_Are_Related_to_Differences_in_Circulating_Hormone_Levels)].

## **Conclusion**

The genetic complexity and variability of the RCCX module are crucial for understanding various autoimmune, endocrine, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The intricate interplay of genes within this module, influenced by endogenous retroviruses and CNVs, underscores the importance of comprehensive genetic analysis in disease research and potential therapeutic developments. The RCCX module's involvement in the stress-diathesis model highlights the need for further studies to elucidate the gene-environment interactions that contribute to disease susceptibility and progression. Continued research into RCCX module variations and their functional implications will shed light on the genetic underpinnings of these complex disorders and guide the development of targeted interventions.
