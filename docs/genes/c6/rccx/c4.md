# **C4 and Its Connection to the RCCX Theory**

The **RCCX module**, located on chromosome 6, is a highly complex and dense genetic region that encompasses several genes, including the **complement component 4 (C4)** gene. The **C4 gene** plays a crucial role in the complement system, which is a part of the innate immune response. The **RCCX theory** suggests that variations within this module, particularly in the C4 gene, contribute to the susceptibility and pathogenesis of various autoimmune and psychiatric disorders through gene-environment interactions.

## **Key Components of the RCCX Module**

The RCCX module consists of the following genes:

- **C4:** Encodes for the complement component 4, which is involved in the classical pathway of the complement system. The C4 gene exists in two distinct isotypes, **C4A** and **C4B**, which can have varying copy numbers and structural variations.
- **CYP21A2:** Encodes for the enzyme **21-hydroxylase**, which is important in steroid hormone biosynthesis. Deficiencies in this gene can lead to **congenital adrenal hyperplasia**.
- **TNXB:** Encodes for the extracellular matrix protein **tenascin-X**, which is involved in matrix organization and cellular signaling.
- **STK19:** Encodes for a **serine/threonine kinase** that may play a role in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.

## **C4 and Disease Associations**

### **Schizophrenia**

Studies have linked overactivity of the C4 gene to an increased risk of schizophrenia. This overactivity may lead to excessive synaptic pruning during brain development, potentially contributing to the onset of the disorder. The **C4 gene** has been identified as a potential cause of schizophrenia due to its role in excessive synaptic pruning.

### **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**

Copy number variants (CNVs) of the C4 gene, particularly the presence of **C4A null alleles (C4AQ0)**, are associated with increased susceptibility and severity of SLE. Additionally, serum levels of complement proteins **C3** and **C4** are critical markers for diagnosing and monitoring SLE disease activity. Low levels of C3 and C4 indicate active disease and complement consumption, while normal levels despite active disease may suggest immune complex consumption.

### **Rheumatological Conditions in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)**

Patients with **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome**, especially the hypermobility type (hEDS), are more prone to developing autoimmune and rheumatological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, SLE, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, and inflammatory eye diseases. This observation suggests a potential genetic link involving the RCCX module and its role in regulating immune function.

## **C4 Structural Variation and Disease Mechanisms**

The structural variation in the C4 gene, including gene dosage differences between males and females, contributes to sex-biased vulnerability in certain autoimmune diseases, such as systemic sclerosis.

The complex structure of the RCCX module, which includes gene duplications and deletions, influences the expression and function of the genes within this module. This complexity impacts immune responses and susceptibility to diseases through various mechanisms, including:

- **Gene-Environment Interactions:** The RCCX module serves as a gateway for understanding gene-environment interactions, which are pivotal in the pathogenesis of complex diseases like schizophrenia and SLE.
- **Ancestral Haplotypes:** The **8.1 ancestral haplotype (AH-8.1)**, characterized by specific C4 and TNFA alleles, is associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases in certain populations.

## **Complement Testing and RCCX**

Complement testing, particularly the measurement of serum **C3** and **C4** levels, is clinically relevant in the diagnosis and monitoring of SLE and other autoimmune disorders. Significant depletion of C3 and C4 indicates active disease and complement consumption, while normal levels despite active disease may suggest immune complex consumption.

The relationship between C4 structural variants, TNFA promoter polymorphisms, and the presence of the AH-8.1 haplotype has been studied in various populations, further elucidating the role of the RCCX module in disease susceptibility.

## **Conclusion**

The **C4 gene**, situated within the complex RCCX module, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and psychiatric disorders through its involvement in the complement system and immune regulation. Understanding the genetic and environmental interactions involving C4 and the RCCX module can provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms and pave the way for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Further research into the complexity of the RCCX module, including its structural variations, gene expression patterns, and interactions with environmental factors, is crucial for unraveling the genetic basis of these diseases and developing targeted treatments.
