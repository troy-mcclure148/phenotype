# **Chromosome 6**

The **RCCX module**, located on chromosome 6, is a complex genetic region that plays a crucial role in the RCCX theory. It contains several genes, including **[CYP21A2](cyp21a2.md)**, **[HERV-K](herv-k.md)**, **[C4](c4.md)**, and **[TNXB](tnxb.md)**. Variations in these genes, such as copy number variations and mutations, have been linked to various disorders, including *congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)*, *autoimmune diseases*, and *connective tissue disorders*. The complex interactions between these genes and their regulatory elements contribute to the diverse phenotypes observed in individuals with RCCX-related conditions.
