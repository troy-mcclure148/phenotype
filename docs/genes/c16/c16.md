# **Chromosome 16**

Chromosome 16 contains the **[TPSAB1](tpsab1.md)** gene, which encodes the *alpha-tryptase* enzyme found in mast cells. Recent research has identified a potential link between increased copy numbers of the **TPSAB1** gene and a subset of individuals with co-occurring conditions such as **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)**, **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)**, and **Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)**. This finding suggests that variations in the **TPSAB1** gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions, possibly through increased mast cell activation and inflammation.
