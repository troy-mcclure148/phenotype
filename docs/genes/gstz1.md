# **Glutathione Transferase Zeta 1 (GSTZ1) and Its Role in Biotransformation and Tyrosine Metabolism**

*Glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1)* is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biotransformation of **dichloroacetate (DCA)** and the metabolism of **tyrosine**. This enzyme is the only known enzyme capable of biotransforming DCA, a compound found in chlorinated water and used as an alternative cancer drug and in the treatment of certain metabolic disorders in children.

## **GSTZ1 and DCA Biotransformation**

DCA is known to inhibit GSTZ1 activity, leading to potential adverse effects. Some key findings related to GSTZ1's role in DCA biotransformation include:

1. **Enzyme Inhibition and Toxicity**: Inhibition of GSTZ1 by DCA results in the accumulation of potentially hepatotoxic tyrosine intermediates, such as *maleylacetoacetate* and *maleylacetone*, as well as *delta-aminolevulinate*, a precursor of heme synthesis associated with neurotoxic effects, including peripheral neuropathy.

2. **Human Polymorphisms and DCA Kinetics**: Human polymorphisms in the **GSTZ1/MAAI** (*maleylacetoacetate isomerase*) gene influence the toxicokinetics of DCA. Different GSTZ1/MAAI haplotypes significantly affect the kinetics and biotransformation of DCA, influencing the urinary accumulation of potentially toxic tyrosine metabolites.

3. **Structural Changes and Enzyme Stability**: Atomic modeling has revealed that GSTZ1/MAAI variants associated with slower rates of DCA metabolism induce structural changes in the enzyme homodimer, potentially leading to protein instability or abnormal protein-protein interactions.

4. **Clinical Implications**: Knowledge of an individual's GSTZ1/MAAI haplotype can be used prospectively to identify those at potential risk of DCA's adverse side effects from environmental or clinical exposure, or who may exhibit aberrant amino acid metabolism in response to dietary protein.

## **GSTZ1 and Tyrosine Metabolism**

In addition to its role in DCA biotransformation, GSTZ1 also serves as a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step in tyrosine (protein) metabolism. Some key points regarding this function include:

1. **Tyrosine Metabolism Pathway**: GSTZ1, also known as *maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI)*, catalyzes the isomerization of *maleylacetoacetate* to *fumarylacetoacetate*, which is then hydrolyzed to *fumarate* and *acetoacetate* in the final step of tyrosine catabolism.

2. **Tyrosinemia Type 1**: Deficiencies in the terminal enzyme of the tyrosine catabolism pathway, *fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase*, lead to the accumulation of *maleylacetoacetate* and *fumarylacetoacetate*, causing hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, a severe metabolic disorder associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.

3. **Dietary Implications**: Individuals with slow GSTZ1/MAAI haplotypes may be genetically predisposed to reduced flux through the phenylalanine and tyrosine catabolic pathway. Chronic consumption of a high-protein diet by such individuals could lead to an accumulation of toxic tyrosine intermediates, with potential adverse consequences for hepatic, neurological, and other organ systems.

## **Potential Clinical Implications**

The role of GSTZ1 in DCA biotransformation and tyrosine metabolism has several potential clinical implications:

1. **DCA Treatment and Adverse Effects**: Careful consideration of age and GSTZ1/MAAI genotype is necessary when conducting treatment-oriented research with DCA, particularly cancer trials involving adults, to identify individuals at risk of adverse side effects.

2. **Hepatotoxicity Risk**: Individuals with acquired GSTZ1 deficiency caused by therapeutic exposure to DCA or those with genetic variants associated with slow DCA metabolism may be at increased risk of drug-induced hepatotoxicity, such as when exposed to acetaminophen or oxidative stress-inducing agents.

3. **Neurological Implications**: The accumulation of toxic tyrosine intermediates due to impaired GSTZ1 activity may have neurological implications, as *delta-aminolevulinate*, a precursor of heme synthesis, has been associated with neurotoxic effects, including peripheral neuropathy.

4. **Dietary Considerations**: Individuals with slow GSTZ1/MAAI haplotypes may benefit from dietary modifications, such as reducing protein intake or supplementing with nutrients that support the tyrosine metabolism pathway, to minimize the accumulation of potentially toxic intermediates.

Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of GSTZ1 polymorphisms and the potential therapeutic interventions or preventive measures that may be necessary for individuals with varying GSTZ1 activities.
