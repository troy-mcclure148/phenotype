# **Chromosome 12**

Chromosome 12 is home to the **[VDR](vit-d.md)** gene, which encodes the *vitamin D receptor*. Vitamin D and its receptor have been implicated in the regulation of various genes, including **CYP21A2**, a key component of the **RCCX module**. 

> **Vitamin D deficiency** has been associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disorders and other chronic conditions, possibly through its effects on immune function and gene regulation.

The interplay between **vitamin D status**, **VDR function**, and **RCCX-related genes** may contribute to the development and severity of certain disorders.
