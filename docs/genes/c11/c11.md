# Chromosome 11

Chromosome 11 contains several genes relevant to the **RCCX theory**, including [**SERPIN-A1**](serpin-a1.md), [**GABA**](gaba.md), and [**CBS**](cbs.md).

- **SERPIN-A1** encodes *alpha-1-antitrypsin*, a protease inhibitor that plays a role in **inflammation** and **tissue damage**.
- **GABA**, or *gamma-aminobutyric acid*, is a neurotransmitter that has been implicated in various **neurological** and **psychiatric disorders**.
- **CBS**, or *cystathionine beta-synthase*, is an enzyme involved in the **transsulfuration pathway** and has been linked to **homocystinuria** and other **metabolic disorders**.

The interactions between these genes and the **RCCX module** may contribute to the complex phenotypes observed in individuals with RCCX-related conditions.
